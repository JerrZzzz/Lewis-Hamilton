    "text": "My Bio\nAs an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, I major in Physics, while minor in Mathematics and Statistical Science. My academic journey is not just about acquiring knowledge; it’s about the thrill of discovery, especially within the realms of Statistical Science — my true passion.\nDelving into datasets, I am captivated by the stories they tell. My forte lies in sifting through numbers to uncover underlying patterns, transforming raw data into predictive powerhouses. This is where I thrive: translating complex data into insightful, future-looking patterns with precision and care.\nMy credentials are supported by a SAS certification, a testament to my expertise in statistical software. Practical experience comes from my time at ICBC, where I not only expanded my technical knowledge but also learned the vital importance of data integrity and interpretation. Crafting reports based on my findings, I add value by turning data into strategic foresight.\nThe course STA302 has been a cornerstone of my education, reinforcing my skills in data analysis. While this bio serves an assignment for the course, my enthusiasm is genuine. STA302 has pushed my boundaries, deepening my appreciation for data’s role in our world. It’s not about seeking approval; it’s about acknowledging a course that has significantly contributed to my academic and professional growth\nCV"
